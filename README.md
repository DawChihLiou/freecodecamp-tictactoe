# Free Code Camp Zipline Build a Tic Tac Toe Game Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find the most recent version of the guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

# Introduction
This [Free Code Camp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game) is developed with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). It also depends on the following javascript libraries
```
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-redux": "^4.4.5",
    "react-scripts": "0.7.0",
    "redux": "^3.6.0",
    "redux-logger": "^2.7.4",
    "redux-thunk": "^2.1.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^3.3.7",
    "react": "^15.3.2",
    "react-dom": "^15.3.2"
  }
}
```
It is a React + Redux exercise. The purpose is to understand how does Redux work with React. This exercise demonstrates how to deal with synchronous actions in Redux and how to render React components with Redux state.

The Tic Tac Toe application has three features: role selection, game board, and auto refresh after game. The application runs a simple algorithm to compute computer's next move and determine whether you win or not.
